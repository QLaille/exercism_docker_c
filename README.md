# exercism_docker_c
DockerFile for C and CPP tracks of Exercism

## Why only the C tracks ?

This is because this Dockerfile relies on [a script I made](https://github.com/QLaille/exercism_mentor_ignore) to comment all lines ignoring tests, and since I don't know the syntax for other languages, it's for C and CPP.
